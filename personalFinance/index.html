						<h1>Intro to Personal Finance</h1>
						<p>This tutorial is meant to take you from being a total newbie to personal finance (for Canada) to get you started.</p>
						<p>This tutorial is my first presentation done with <a href="https://revealjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RevealJS</a>.  It uses the <a href="https://revealjs.com/plugins/#built-in-plugins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reveal Zoom</a> plugin, which allows you to zoom in on elements with <kbd>Alt+click</kbd> (<kbd>Ctrl+click</kbd> on Linux).  I also had to do some of my own hacking to allow you to zoom in with <kbd>Ctrl++</kbd> and scroll on images.</p>

					<h1>Basic Theory - Corporations</h1>
					<h2>Basic Principle 1: Corporations Exist to Make Profits</h2>
					<p>As long as corporations make things, market them, and sell them, there will be profits.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Basic Principle 2: It Takes Money To Make Money</h2>
					<p>Corporations often need to acquire funds, apart from profits, to make profits.
					<p>They can do this by borrowing money (by selling <b>bonds</b>), or sell pieces, or <b>shares</b>, of themselves (by selling <b>stocks</b>).</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Bonds</h3>
					<p>Corporations and governments sell bonds, which pay interest.<p>
					<p>If you buy a bond, you can sell it to someone else.  You can buy a bond from a government, corporation, or someone who owns a bond.</p>
					<p>When interest rates go up, bonds sold at a lower interest rate become less valuable, and can be sold at a lower price than when it was bought.</p>
					<p>When interest rates go down, bonds sold at a higher interest rate become more valuable, and can be sold at a higher price than when it was bought.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Bonds - Part 2</h3>
					<p>With bonds, if the company does really well, you still only get the interest that was stated when they issued the bond.</p>
					<p>On the one hand, you really miss out if the company does well. On the other hand, you don't take a loss if the company doesn't do well - unless they default on their bonds, which is rare in a high-rated bond.<p>
					<p>So, with bonds, you don't get the massive ups and downs you get with stocks. Instead you get stability and predictability.</p>
					<p>Furthermore, interest income is taxed at a high rate compared with other investment income.</p>
					<p>We'll return to bonds, and taxes, later.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Stocks</h3>
					<p>Corporations sell parts of themselves as shares, or stocks.</p>
					<p>The price of a share is a combination of underlying value (the worth of all it's assets, including intellectual property), and speculation of to how well the company will do in the future.<p>
					<p>If a company is expected to do well, a lot of people want to buy shares in it, and fewer want to sell; so the price of each share goes up.  Apple is expected to keep making large profits by selling lots of expensive electronics, and many more dongles. So their stock price is high.</p>
					<p>But if Tim Cook announced tomorrow that they were switching their entire product line to garlic-flavoured mittens, it would be expected that there would be few profits. Suddenly, no one would want to own Apple stock. So they'd offer to sell. But no one would want to buy.  So they'd have to offer to sell at a lower price until someone wanted to buy at that low price. The price of stock would fall.<p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Stocks - Part 2</h3>
					<p>If the company does really well, so do you.  But if the company does really pooly, so do you.</p>
					<p>Stocks are risky.  Imagine buying Apple stock in the mid 80s (like Forrest Gump), or even in 1997. If you sold that stock today, your working days would likely be over.</p>
					<p>But imagine buying lots of BRE-X stock at its height in 1996.  A year later, you'd have lost your shirt.</p>
					<p>In either of those cases, a rational person would sell Apple in 1997 (before Steve Jobs returned) to cut their losses.  And a rational person would buy BRE-X thinking they were sitting on a gold mine.</p>
					<p>Bottom line: You can't predict the future. Stocks are high risk, which offer high rewards, or massive losses.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Basic Theory - Corporations - Conclusion</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Corporations need to raise money, either through lending money (bonds) selling pieces of themselves (stocks).</li>
						<li>Stocks are high risk. Bonds are low risk.</li>
						<li>Very few people can predict the future. You can't. And you can't pick who can.</li>
						<li>Bonds fall under the umbrella of "fixed income".</li>
						<li>Stocks fall under the umbrella of "equities".</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Next, we'll talk about which stocks to buy.</p>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section>
				<section>
					<h1>Which Stocks Do I buy?</h1>
					<p>Apple, obviously.</p>
					<p>But what if Apple <em>did</em> switch to only selling garlic-flavoured mittens? You'd lose your shirt.  But Samsung would sell a lot more phones. And Dell would sell more computers.  So buy Apple, and to hedge your bets, buy Dell, and Samsung.</p>
					<p>"But what about banks and energy companies? Shouldn't I buy them too?"</p>
					<p>Yes. Yes, you should.</p>
					<p>"Which ones?"</p>
					<p>All of them.  That way, when some go down, others go up, and you benefit.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Which Stocks Do I buy? - Part 2</h2>
					<p>"If I buy all of them, won't that be very expensive? Not to mention all the paperwork involving tracking all of them.  What a hassel!"</p>
					<p>Yes. Those are very good points.</p>
					<p>"So, what's the solution?  As Homer Simpson said: Can't someone else do it?"<br><img src="someone_else.png" alt="Can't someone else do it?"></p>
					<p>Absolutely! That's the best way to go! Let someone else buy a bunch of stocks, and you (and other people) buy shares of that large portfolio.  This is the basis of mutual funds and ETFs.<p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Indexes</h2>
					<p>An Index is a collection of stocks and/or bonds.  It could be every stock on a single exchange. Or a group of stocks in a region. Or a set of large company's stocks.</p>
					<p>Common indexes include the S&amp;P 500, the Nasdaq-100, FTSE-100.</p>
					<p>When you hear on the news "The TSX rose by half a percentage", that means that some of stocks that trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) increased in value, and a bunch went down.  If you add up all the ups, and subtracted all the downs, it would the total change of the TSX that day.</p>
					<p>An Index Fund that tracks the TSX, for example, would be a collection of stocks that trade on the TSX.  In our example, on that date, if you owned a share of that index fund, it's value would have been gone up by 0.5%.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>The Power of Index Funds</h2>
					<p>Buying a fund that tracks "the index" (or several indexes) allows you to buy several stocks and/or bonds at once.</p>
					<p>In the short term (less than 5 years) index funds are pretty risky.  But, the longer the time period, the safer index funds become.  On average, the S&mp;P 500 returns 5 to 7 percent after inflation per year.</p>
					<p>It's best to hold stocks from as many industries and geography's as possible.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>What Stocks To Buy - Conclusion</h2>
					<p>Buy all of the stocks, and bonds, by buying index funds.</p>
					<p>Next, we'll talk about <em>how</em> to buy all of them.</p>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section>
				<section>
					<h1>Mutual Funds and ETFs</h1>
					<p>Mutual funds and ETFs are both collections of stocks and/or bonds that can be bought in pieces, also called shares.</p>
					<p>When you buy a share of an ETF or mutual fund, you get a small piece of that entire collection.</p>
					<p>Mutual funds are often sold by banks, or financial advisors, or other institutions.  They can be bought and sold whenever those institutions are open for business.  Partial shares can often be purchased.</p>
					<p>ETFs, or Exchange Traded Funds, are bought and sold directly on the stock market, and can only be bought and sold when the markets are open for trading.  Typically, only whole shares can be purchased.  (As of this writing, I believe Wealth Simple allows for partial purchases of ETFs.)</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Mutual Funds</h2>
					<p>A big difference is that mutual funds are often actively managed.  This means that they are managed by people who think they can pick stocks that will go up, sell stocks before they go down, and/or time the market in general.<p>
					<p>Problem is:  very, very, very few people can do that consistently over several years. See earlier slides.  But those who can, at least for a while, command large salaries. Those salaries have to be paid for. And they are, by fees, or MERs - Management Expense Ratios - a percentage of your shares are taken off the top and pay for the management.</p>
					<p>Actively managed funds often times have high MERs; around 2.0 to 2.3% is common in Canada.  Over time these feeds add up.</p>
					<p>Some mutual funds are passively managed, and tend to have lower MERs.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>ETFs</h2>
					<p>ETFs are mostly (if not entirely) passively managed. They're holdings are often simply based on an algorithm.  As such, MERs tend to be much lower.  Generally below 0.5%.  Over the course of several years, the differences in those fees can make differences in the tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Mutual Funds and ETFs - Conclusion</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Instead of buying individual stocks and bonds that represent an index, let someone else do that, and buy a collection of them.</li>
						<li>Index funds allow for effortless diversivication across industries and geographies.</li>
						<li>The best way to do this is by buying ETFs.</li>
					</ul>

					<h1>Basic Theory - Taxes</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>Taxes are one of the two certainties in life</li>
						<li>You pay tax on income.</li>
						<li>How much tax you pay depends on several factors, including, but not limited to:
							<ul>
								<li>Your tax bracket</li>
								<li>The amount of income</li>
								<li>The type of income</l1>
								<li>What type of account the money is made in.</li>
							</ul></li>
					</ul>
					<p>We'll deal with each of these in turn.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Tax Brackets</h2>
					<p>Myth: "I got a raise, and now I'm in the next tax bracket and my take-home is smaller."</p>
					<p>This never happens. That's not how tax brackets work.  You only pay the tax rate on income in each bracket.</p>
					<p>As of this writing, the lowest tax bracket (for Canada), is 15% from $0 up to $&nbsp;55&nbsp;875.99.  The next tax bracket is 20.5% up to $&nbsp;111&nbsp;772.99.</p>
					<p>So if your salary was $&nbsp;55&nbsp;870, you would pay 15% on all of that (or $&nbsp;8380.50), leaving you with $&nbsp;47&nbsp;489.50. Then, if you got a raise taking you up to $&nbsp;55&nbsp;880, then you would still pay 15% on the first $&nbsp;55&nbsp;875.99, then then 20.5% on the $&nbsp;5 in the second tax bracket (or $&nbsp;0.82).<p>
					<p>So, before the raise, you would have taken home $&nbsp;47&nbsp;489.50.  After the raise you'd take home $&nbsp;47&nbsp;497.78.</p>
					<p>Now, your <strong>marginal tax rate</strong> is 20.5%.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>The Type of Income</h2>
					<p>For our purposes there are three types of income:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Capital gains</li>
						<li>Dividend income</l1>
						<li>Regular income</li>
					</ol>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Capital gains</h3>
					<p>When you sell an equity (rental property, stock, bond, ETF, mutual fund, etc.), if the amount you sold it for is higher than the amount you paid for it, the difference is the Capital Gain.</p>
					<p>As of this writing, you pay your marginal tax rate on 50% of the capital gain.  (There is an exception if the capital gain is over $&nbsp;250&nbsp;000, but if you're reading this, then that probably doesn't apply to you.)</p>
					<p>For example, if you're in the second tax bracket if you buy some stocks for $&nbsp;100, and sell later for $&nsp;180. The capital gain is $&nbsp;80.  Divide that by 2, to get $&nbsp;40.  You marginal tax rate is 20.5%, so you pay 20.5% on that $&nbsp;40; or $&nbsp;8.20.  So you keep $&nbsp;171.80 ($&nbsp;180 - $&nbsp;8.20).</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Dividends</h3>
					<p>When a corporation makes a profit, they generally re-invest the profits to grow the company (which generally makes the stock price rise), or they distribute to the profits to shareholders.  These distributions are dividends.</p>
					<p>Furthermore, the corporation has, at this point, paid corporate tax on those profits.  Then, shareholders pay the difference between the corporate taxes and personal tax rates through a "gross up" procedure, which is beyond the scope of this tutorial.  But, ultimately it's less that what you would pay if it were regular income.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Regular Income</h3>
					<p>This would include employment income, rental income, interest income, etc.  You pay your marginal tax rate on this income.</p>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section>
				<section>
					<h1>Minimizing Taxes</h1>
					<p>The government allows you to minimize your income tax by placing your investments in different types of accounts:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>RRSP</li>
						<li>TFSA</li>
						<li>Unregistered account</li>
					</ul>
					<p>We'll deal with each in turn.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>RRSP</h2>
					<p>When you contribute to your RRSP, the amount you contribute is taken off your taxable income for the year. So you pay less income tax at your marginal rate.</p>
					<p>When income is generated in an RRSP (interest, dividends, capital gains, etc.) it's not taxed at all as long as it's in the RRSP.</p>
					<p>When money is taken out of the RRSP (either directly, or through an RRIF - Registered Retirement Income Fund), it's treated as regular income - regardless if it was income generated by interest, capital gain, or dividend.  However, in retirement, you're marginal tax rate may be lower, so you'll ultimately pay less tax.</p>
					<p>When you do withdraw from your RRSP, that contribution room is gone.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>TFSA</h2>
					<p>When you contribute to a TFSA, there is no change to your taxable income for the year.</p>
					<p>Income generated within a TFSA (interest, dividends, capital gains, etc.) are not taxed.</p>
					<p>When you withdraw from your TFSA, it's still not taxed.</p>
					<p>When you do withdraw, you can re-contribute that amount at the start of the next year - on top of the regular allowable contribution amount.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Unregistered Account</h2>
					<p>All income is taxed as described in the tax section.</p>
					<p>But there no contribution limits to an unregistered account.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Where you should put your money</h2>
					<p>There are too many variables to consider to answer that here.  But here are some rules of thumb:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>It's never a bad idea to max out your TFSA if possible</li>
						<li>If you're job comes with a defined benefit pension plan, you may want to de-prioritize investing in an RRSP, because you'll likely be in an impressive tax bracket when you retire.</li>
						<li>But if your employer does RRSP contribution matching, then take full advantage!</li>
						<li>There are tax advantages (beyond the scope of this tutorial) of holding foreign equities in an RRSP that don't exist for TFSAs</li>
						<li>RRSP's are good if you're prone to use your long term investments for short term desires.
					</ul>

					<p>Can't I just buy the stocks that will go up?  Buy low, and sell high, and all that.</p>
					<p>Sure!  If you have a crystal ball!  Fact is, very few people can consistently predict which stocks will go up, when the rise will stop; or when a stock will go down, and when the fall will stop. Statistically, you're more likely to get rich via the lottory than be able to do that. Furthermore, you can't tell who <em>can</em> consitently make those predictions.  And if you could, since there are precious few of them, you couldn't afford their services.</p>

					<h1>Commits</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>A commit represents a snapshot in time of a branch of a repo.</li>
						<li>It's the changes in all the files since the last commit on that branch.</li>
						<li>Each comes with a bunch of meta data about that commit, such as a note about the commit, and a hash representing that commit.</li>
						<li>Commits are just a snapshot.  Making a commit doesn't upload it to GitHub, or merge it into another branch.</li>
						<li>Committing is just telling Git "Okay, remember the state of all these files right.....<em><strong>now!</strong></em>"</li>
						<li>Committing allows you to merge, or upload your changes to GitHub.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Branching</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>A Branch is an independent line of development.</li>
							<li>A Branch is a series of commits.</li>
							<li>Branching is done <em>within</em> an instance of a repo.</li>
							<li>Everyone with access to <em>that</em> repo instance can see all its branches.</li>
							<li>Branching creates a copy of all the tracked files at the time of branching.</li>
							<li>As you edit files in the new branch, the files in the original branch remain unchanged from the time you created the new branch.</li>
							<li>Anyone with access to that instance of that repo can create a new branch from the original (without your changes) or your new branch (with your changes up to the last commit on your branch); or edit the files in the original branch.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Branching</h3>
						<p>A repo starts out with a main branch: a set of files with a history of changes (ie: commits).</p>

						<h3>Branching</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Create a branch when you're going to start doing work (fixing a bug, adding a new feature).</li>

						<h3>Branching</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>If you're part way through adding a feature, and need to fix a bug: create a branch from <code>main</code> that won't include any of the unfinished code in your new feature.</li>
							<li>As long as the changes on the different branches aren't in the same spot in the same file, Git should be smart enough to merge them without issue.</li>
							<li>If there are changes to the same spot in the same file, then a merge conflict will arise, and will needed to be sorted out manually.  That's beyond the scope of this tutorial.</li>
							<li><code>$ git checkout main</code><br><em>then</em><br><code>$ git branch other_new_branch_name</code></li>

						<h2>Cloning</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Cloning creates a copy of the repo on your computer.</li>
							<li>Downloads all files in the <code>main</code> branch, including config files.</li>
							<li>Sets the cloned-from repo as the <code>origin</code> remote.</li>
							<li>Use this (ie: cloning) when you first want to contribute to a repo.</li>
							<li>Only use once on each computer.  Once you've cloned, the repo is there.  You have it.  From then on, to get the latest code, use <code>git pull</code> or <code>git rebase</code>.</li>

						<h2>Forking</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Forking a repo creates an instance of a repo (branches, commit history, etc.) on your own GitHub account.</li>

						<h1>Cloning, Branching, and Forking</h1>
						<dl>
							<dt>Cloning</dt>
							<dd>Copies a repo (files and some configuration) from one computer to another</dd>
							<dd>Used when starting to contribute to a project for the very first time on that computer.</dd>
							<dt>Branching</dt>
							<dd>Creates a copy of all files in a repo so they can be edited without affecting the original files</dd>
							<dd>Used when adding a feature or fixing a bug</dd>
							<dt>Forking</dt>
							<dd>Creates a copy of a repo (on the same system as the original repo) to the forkers account</dd>
							<dd>Used when either creating a brand new thing based on an old thing.  (Ex: Waterfox is a fork of Firefox.  Waterfox will never merge back into Firefox).</dd>
							<dd>Also can be used where there are a lot of people on a project when "branch hell" and "commit history hell" is to be avoided.</dd>
							<dd>Also can be used when you want to do some experimental things knowing you'll problably throw your copy away when you're done.</dd>

					<h1>Workflows</h1>
					<p>There are two basic workflows when contributing to a project or repo:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>When you have write access to the original repo;</li>
						<li>When you don't have write access to the original repo;</li>
					</ol>
					<p>The first is usually when you're part of a team that works on a project.  No forking is necessary; just cloning and branching.</p>
					<p>The second is usually when you're not part of the organization, but want to contribute anyway.</p>
					<p>For these examples, assume the repo has already been cloned.</p>
				</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Workflow With Write Access To Repo</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>For our example, Jane Schmoe is part of the organization.  She doesn't need to <code>clone</code> (because that was already done before when she first joined the org).</li>
							<li>But she needs to <code>pull</code> before she gets started.</li>
							<li>Pulling gets the latest commits from <em>elsehwere</em> and merges them <em>here</em>.</li>
							<li>In this case, Jane pulls from the <code>origin</code> so she has everything on her computer.</li>
						</ul>
						<div class="imageHolder">
							<a href="images/org-local-workflow-1.svg" target="_blank" title="Click to open in a new window"><img src="images/org-local-workflow-1.svg" alt="Pulling gets the current state of the branch from which you pull from the remote from which you pull."></a>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p style="color:#AA0000;"><strong>Do not</strong> explain the anatomy of your local repo.  That comes in a few slides.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Starting Work</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>After pulling, but before starting to work, she creates a new branch.  It's dangerous to work on the main branch.</li>
						</ul>

					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Your Local Repo</h3>
						<p>At this point it's worth mentioning how your local repo works.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Your local copy has three parts:  The <strong>Index</strong> or <strong>Working Directory</strong>, <strong>Staging</strong>, and the <strong>repo</strong> itself.</li>
							<li>When you're editing files locally, simply saving them has no effect on the repo itself.</li>
							<li>When you add a new file into your folder, it still isn't part of the repo.  It's not being tracked.</li>
							<li>All your edits, additions, and removals are all part of the "Working Directory" or the "Index".</li>
							<li>In order to get Git to start tracking new files and updated files you need to move them to "Staging".</li>
							<li>Moving to staging can be done by <code>$ git add filename</code>, or to add all at once: <code>$ git add .</code> (inlcuding the ".").</li>
							<li><strong><em>Then</em></strong>, once staged, files can be <em>committed</em> to the repo.</li>
							<li>This can be done with: <code>$ git commit -m "Some notes about the commit here"</code>.</li>
							<li>Once changes have been committed, a new commit (ie: a snapshot in time) is created.</li>
							<li>This commit can now be merged into another local branch, or pushed to a remote.</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Now, back to Jane.  She's added her feature and is ready to be staged and committed.</p>
						</aside>

						<h1>Useful git Commands</h1>
						<dl>
							<dt><code>git status</code></dt>
							<dd>Tells you what branch you're on, what files are in your working directory, but not staging; staging but not the repo.  Sometimes gives you hints as to what to do next.</dd>
							<!--
							<dt><code>git branch [branch_name]</code></dt>
							<dd>Creates a branch called "branch_name" in your local working directory of your local repo.
							<br>
							Example: <code>$ git branch myNewFeature</code></dd>
							-->
							<dt><code>git checkout [branch_name]</code></dt>
							<dd>Sets your current working directory to be in the branch called "branch_name".
							<br>
							Example: <code>$ git checkout myNewFeature</code> puts you into the <code>myNewFeature</code> branch.  Now all changes you make won't affect any other branch in your repo until you merge the changes into them.</dd>
						</dl>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Useful git Commands (cont.)</h2>
						<dl>
							<dt><code>git pull [remote_name] [branch_name]</code></dt>
							<dd>Fetches the branch called "branch_name" from the remote called ["remote_name"] into your local repo, and merges the changes into your Working Directory into whatever branch you have checked out at the moment.<br>
							Example (continuing from above): <code>$ git pull origin main</code> pulls the <code>main</code> branch of the <code>origin</code> remote into your <code>myNewFeature</code> branch.</dd>
							<dt><code>git add .</code></dt>
							<dd>Get's all your changes ready for commiting by adding them from your Working Directory into your Staging Area.</dd>
						</dl>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Useful git Commands (cont.)</h2>
						<dl>
							<dt><code>git commit -m "Commit notes go here"</code></dt>
							<dd>Makes a snapshop in time; commits your changes to your local copy of the repo.  It's ready to be pushed.  Note:  You can add the <code>-a</code> option to skip the previous step if there are no <em>new</em> files added.<br>
							Example: <code>$ git commit -a -m "Fixed a typo identified in Issue #34"</code><dd>
							<dt><code>git push [remote_name] [branch_name]</code></dt>
							<dd>Copies your latest commits to the branch called "branch_name" on the remote called "remote_name".  If <code>[branch_name]</code> doesn't exist on <code>[remote_name]</code>, then one will be created.<br>
							Example (continuing from above): <code>$ git push origin myNewFeature</code> copies your changes in your <code>myNewFeature</code> branch to your repo on GitHub.</dd>
